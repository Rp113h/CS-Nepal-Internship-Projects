# Employee Management System 
This is an employee management system. I have used PHP and Laravel framework in making of it. 
## Features 
1. Provides interface for registration of new employees.
2. Enables to view list of all registered employees.
3. Easily update the required details of registered employees individually from front-end interface.
4. Provided option to delete employee records if required.
5. Responsive, interactive and user-friendly interface. 

## Technologies Used -
**PHP:** The core language for server-side logic.
**Laravel Framework:** Leveraged for its powerful MVC architecture, simplifying development and enhancing maintainability.
**HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Used for creating the front-end interface, ensuring a polished and dynamic user experience.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Employee Management System, follow these steps:
1. Ensure PHP is installed on your system. You can download it from [php.net](php.net).
2. Install composer in your system. Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. Install Composer from [getcomposer.org](getcomposer.org).
3. Install Laravel installer using command:
      ```bash
      composer global require laravel/installer
      ```
4. As laravel is installed globally; navigate to any directory where you want to create your project.
5. Use following command to create a new laravel project.
      ```bash
      laravel new your-project-name
      ```
7. Once project is created, open in any IDE or code editor of your choice.
8. Navigate to specific folders and apply changes as you require.
9. Configure the database connection in the .env file.
10. Navigate to your project directory in the terminal/command prompt, and run migrations using following command.
      ```bash
      php artisan migrate
      ``` 
12. Similarly once again navigate to project directory, and in terminal run following command to execute your laravel project.
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```
14. Your Laravel application is now running locally on your machine. By default it is hosted on 'http://127.0.0.1:8000'.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
